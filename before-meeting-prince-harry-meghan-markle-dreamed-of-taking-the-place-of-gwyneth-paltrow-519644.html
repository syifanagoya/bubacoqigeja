So, as everyone knows, the actress started with interesting notes or personal observations on the topic of beauty and health. After that, she created a commercial site with her own line of natural cosmetics, household products, etc.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In April 2017, Meghan closed her favorite blog about life because much more serious changes awaited her ahead.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“After nearly three great years of this adventure with you, it’s time to say goodbye to The Tig.
