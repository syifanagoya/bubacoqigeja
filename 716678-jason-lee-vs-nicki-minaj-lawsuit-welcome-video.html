Not only did she invite a group of young, male, up-and-coming rappers (though they're also being described as goons) to join her in the studio, but she also showed off some dance moves that arguably weren't her best. In response to all the criticism, the mother of one later sent out a message to her haters via her Instagram Story.</p><p>"They want you to be mad so bad that when you happy having fun they say something wrong with you," Minaj wrote over a black screen. "When I see them saying that I know I got under that dingy skin 🥴😝😂😂😂😂😂😂. A millionaire joking around. That's all it is boo. Coming for youuuuuuu. Threeee four better 🔒 your 🚪. #PinkFriday2 11.17.23." It's unclear exactly who the menacing message is aimed at, though it could possibly be DJ Akademiks, who called out the Trinidadian in a <a href=# rel>scathing rant</a> recently.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>“Queen Radio”: Nicki Minaj Hits The Studio With NY Rappers, Dances Salaciously For The Camera</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-has-a-message-for-her-haters>Nicki Minaj Has a Message for Her Haters</h2></span><p>Another blogger currently in the midst of some drama with Minaj is Hollywood Unlocked's Jason Lee. Since accusing the "Barbie Tingz" hitmaker's husband of coming after him, the media personality has had the internet speculating that a lawsuit is soon to come. "Before y'all say [she] will sue me, we welcome a discovery with these folks," he clarified. "All phone records, bank and wire transactions, emails – everything."</p><p>Additionally, Lee addressed Minaj and her man in a video message, making it clear that he doesn't plan on backing down. "See, what Nicki and Kenny thought was, 'Jason's a pu**y, he's not gonna say anything,'" the podcast host speculated. "Are you f**king d*mb? I'm the same ni**a that put out how you tried to punk <a href=# class=text-word rel>Future</a>. I'm the same ni**a that put out your original track on 'MotorSport' when you said you never changed your verse," Lee began to list all the times he's exposed the 40-year-old.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Jason Lee Targeted By Nicki Minaj, Kenneth Petty, And Their Affiliates: Report</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Lee is Ready for War</h2></span><p>Keep scrolling to see Jason Lee's full video message to Nicki Minaj and Kenneth Petty.
