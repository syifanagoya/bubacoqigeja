Following an embarrassing incident at her brother's wedding, Rosie realises that her addictions are destroying her friendships, family and work life and attempts to break her bad habits for good.&nbsp;</p><p id=enmhm09jv-Qe data-wc=69>"Rosie is single, she's got a great family, is very much a career girl, she's just been promoted at work and she seems to have it all," said Sheridan.&nbsp;"But, at the same time, she does not have it all. <strong>She's a very complex character because she is suffering the illness of addiction.</strong> She's got a huge heart though, but she has the illness and gets addicted to everything."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7354d647a4ab-rosie-molloy-sheridan-smith-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ewlszJ7upTBj data-wc=6><strong>Sheridan Smith stars as Rosie Molloy</strong></p><h2>Pauline McLynn plays Win Molloy</h2><p id=eQbsNfY-FAZL data-wc=18>Irish actress Pauline plays Rosie's mother Win, who like her daughter, has her own problems to deal with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=ecyw4zbtAHpI data-wc=41>Speaking about her character, Pauline said: "Win is the mother of the family, but she is no less daft than the rest of them. Just because she's the mum doesn’t mean she's any better in a family crisis than anyone else.&nbsp;</p><p id=epoYO8k5fxsB data-wc=22>"<strong>In fact, we learn that there was a family tragedy, some years beforehand</strong>, and Win handled it very badly. They all did."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7ce4c38b912f-pauline-mclynn-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e2mRakQgIQrU data-wc=6><strong>Pauline McLynn plays Rosie's mother&nbsp;Win&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Ardal O'Hanlon plays Conall Molloy&nbsp;</h2><p id=eRbNfphftkGE data-wc=23>Ardal plays Rosie's father, with whom he shares a very close relationship and has his own bad habits that have influenced his daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=eAO89NwmbRRO data-wc=77>"He's possibly not the best role model in the world for Rosie," Ardal said about his character. "He's got his own issues to deal with but I think his instinct at all times is to have fun. That's his coping mechanism. <strong>The family has had a trauma in the past and they've never dealt with it.</strong> His way of dealing with whatever life throws at them, generally, is to drink more. So he never takes anything seriously."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/95b786a3a90d-ardal-ohanlon-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eEGf4YV4XY1c data-wc=6><strong>Ardal O'Hanlon plays Rosie's dad Conall&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Lewis Reeves plays Joey Molloy&nbsp;</h2><p id=em8TpANZZ_z4 data-wc=61>Lewis plays Rosie's brother, schoolteacher Joey. "Life is probably going in the way that he wanted it to go," the actor said. "He’s very black and white. Susan actually said, 'He's such an uptight little weirdo like you!', haha, he's got a good heart and he loves his sister but thinks she's a mess and is very tired of her behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=ef-DmmCkSXEi data-wc=35>"<strong>He's been through the same things as her, but he doesn't have an addiction</strong> and I think it's hard for him to understand. So it was really fun to play against Sheridan and that energy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/130bc3ffb8de-lewis-reeves-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eEQxSx6qxa_x data-wc=6><strong>Lewis Reeves plays Rosie's brother Joey&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Leah MacRae plays Monica</h2><p id=e5IpmfE4LhH4 data-wc=43>Leah plays Monica, one of Rosie's colleagues who aspires to be like her. "She's always got something, some drama, or brings light relief to quite a dark scene," said Leah of her character. "She is obsessed with Rosie and models herself on her.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-2DRdQXJnWA data-wc=23>"<strong>Monica is probably one of Rosie's worst enablers </strong>because she will say yes to anything she can do to make her life happy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3bad59568851-leah-macrae-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eYcxsxN-BRo0 data-wc=6><strong>Leah MacRae plays Rosie's colleague Monica</strong></p><h2>Oliver Wellington plays Nico&nbsp;</h2><p id=e_vU4IIba1yt data-wc=17>Oliver Wellington plays Rosie's flatmate Nico, who shares similar characteristics to Rosie and encourages her indulgent behaviour.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDXE3lUPuDL3 data-wc=50>"Nico is like all of my friends and me in one person," Oliver said. "<strong>You rarely see that or a queer character written so well.</strong> He can be quite camp but he’s more than that. He can be funny and nasty and cutting but he’s got a heart to him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7610ff697b1-oliver-wellington-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e9s-hpxAOF2R data-wc=6><strong>Oliver Wellington plays Rosie's flatmate Nico</strong></p><h2>Adelle Leonce plays Ruby</h2><p id=eXkq6O2WiO6_ data-wc=18>Adelle plays Joey's fiancée, Ruby, who has a close relationship with Rosie and the rest of the family.&nbsp;</p><p id=epEeguUwLauf data-wc=31>"Throughout the years, <strong>Rosie and Ruby have formed their own friendship </strong>without Joey and have become quite close," said Adelle.
