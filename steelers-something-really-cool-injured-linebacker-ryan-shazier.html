However, Shazier made a triumphant, emotional return to the franchise during the NFL Draft, walking across the stage to announce Pittsburgh's first-round pick. It was a touching moment – but the Steelers' latest move is even more admirable."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That means Shazier, who's on the PUP list and won't play this year, can make his money immediately.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-257926 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-951620696.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-257926 class=wp-caption-text>Ronald Martinez/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are no salary cap implications for Pittsburgh since this is the final year of Shazier's contract, and the money was guaranteed anyway. But at Shazier's request, the team offered him his money several months in advance.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's a great gesture of goodwill for a player recovering from a scary hit. Shazier's fiancee Michelle aided him across the stage, and he still may never play football again. But those medical bills and physical therapy will be easier to cover with his new signing bonus.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And who knows? Shazier has already made more progress than most people expected. He may one day find himself back on the field. The Steelers will certainly be rooting for him.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjqyrnp2cmr%2B0edKopJ6smJ67qHnRnpilpKlisLC7y2agp6Klp7KlecuipZ6akZi4pr6Mq7Capl2otaLGyJ6paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
