The British beauty, who started dating Statham in 2010, shows her toned tummy in a navy two-piece outfit with brown leather accents.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked by Self what’s different about her relationship with Statham, the Victoria’s Secret Angel said simply, “Everything.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=638 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Rosie Huntington Whiteley Self Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“We’re best mates,” she spilled. “He makes me laugh every day. I almost feel like I never had a proper boyfriend before!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One thing about J and I, we just get on with our relationship,” Huntington-Whiteley said, explaining that the couple pays little attention to rumors about alleged breakups or crises. “The other day, someone said to me, ‘I really respect how private you guys are.’ I said, ‘Really? That’s interesting.’ It’s more work to put your relationship out there than it is to keep it behind closed doors. But my relationship is not a branch of my brand. It’s my private life. Certainly, that’s how he feels, too.”</p><p>The Transformers 3 star, who is expanding her acting repertoire with a gig in the upcoming Mad Max: Fury Road, went on to hint that her private relationship with Statham has an exciting future ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>“For any couple that’s been together for a certain amount of time, there’s a massive amount of pressure to get married,” she said of potential wedding bells. “I totally believe in marriage, but being in a happy relationship is much more important to me… [Kids are] something that’s more realistic in the near future.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmoq5maeqnBza2gp5%2BkpLtuw8eiq56kla56o7vYn6minZ6Zequt0qilZquklsGprcxmoKxlna56o7HSrWSmmaSaenN8kG5pa2w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
