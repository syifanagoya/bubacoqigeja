The Viktor & Rolf design — which debuted on the fashion house’s spring/summer Haute Couture Fashion Week runway in January — features a deconstructed silhouette. The garment is equipped with a blush-colored corset attached to a protruding blue ballgown — that appears to have been digitally rotated to the right of Hosk’s body."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There is a disconnect between what we see, and the physicality of the product.” The dressmakers explained that the capsule is also meant to represent the shakiness of life. “The information that comes at us, going from making a banana cake to so many people being killed in Ukraine.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This wouldn’t be the first time a major brand pulled off a jaw-dropping look on the runway.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In September 2022, <a href=#><strong>Bella Hadid</strong></a> had a dress <a href=#>painted on to her body</a> during the Coperni spring/summer 2023 show during Paris Fashion Week.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“For spring 2023, @coperni dedicated its runway to ‘women of this world,’” Vogue wrote via Instagram alongside a clip of the show-stopping fashion show finale. In the video, Hadid, 25, posed onstage wearing nothing but a nude thong as two men spray painted directly onto her body. After the material came together to form the shape of a figure-hugging, midi-length dress, an artist finished the ensemble with some strips of fabric and scissors.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Hadid then strutted down the catwalk wearing the finished dress — a white, off-the-shoulder garb with a thigh-high slit.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Keep scrolling to see Hosk at Cannes:<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvEpaqaZZikwKx51p6Yq6tdpL21tcKao2ahnKHCtLXOp2SdqpWowG6t02aamqaemsBussilpGaelajBqsLApWSpoZOofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
