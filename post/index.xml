Simply said, pitless cherries (such as Maraschino cherries) are not cultivated in the United States of America. Rather, they are fabricated. It is not possible to grow pitless cherries or other “stone” fruits (such as peaches, apricots, and plums) since there is no seedless variation available. Traditionally, cherries are pitted using a knife, which is the customary method.
