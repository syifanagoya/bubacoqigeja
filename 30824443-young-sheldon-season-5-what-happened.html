I mostly hated all the characters in TBBT, especially Sheldon. I could only take him in very small doses. I love every character in YS. Especially Zoe Perry and the one who plays Missy. They are the heart of the show. IA is not queeny. Typical revolting DLers trying to sex up/gay up a normal kid. Fans are very divided on the drama this season. A third say they will quit watching.

I love to him him speak. The character I like the least is his colleague Wayne, who is shown as the epitome of all things perfect. The mom is hilarious, the faces she makes and the ways she talks. What I find strange about Sheldon is that he never has a moment's doubt. He deals with a lot of rejection and it never affects his self-esteem. I thought he was intolerable on ABBT and couldn't understand why anyone put up with his smug condescension. it would have been far better if the writers made him gay, like the actor who plays him.

It's rare that all the comedies in the 8 to 10 time slot were new episodes. They continually tried to force feed us the awful Afghani show and then the bowling show. And they cancelled B Positive which had some issues (looking at you Linda Lavin) but overall was a good show. Well Les Moonvees or whoever the heck is in charge now if it's not YS, Ghosts or BP I and my 80something parents will continually fight over what to watch in between those shows watching 30 seconds of 60 different channels.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 45</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 17, 2022 5:00 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Meemaw is the breakout character for me.

His lines are minimal.. But he did DRAG which was no surprise at all. I expected Mary to finally hook up with Hot Youth Pastor (which would have been a twist if SHE were the one who cheated)--but the show chickened out.
