For the past&nbsp;two decades and counting, Fat Joe has been married to&nbsp;Lorena Cartagena (nee Milan) also known as Lola.</p><p>Although Joe likes to keep his family as private as possible, he has&nbsp;severally gushed about his wife on social media. Unlike her husband, very little is known about&nbsp;Lorena but going through her social media pages, it was obvious that she adores her family so much.</p><p>Lorena and Joe have&nbsp;a very beautiful daughter named&nbsp;Azaria. She was born on&nbsp;May 12, 2006, and&nbsp;is exploring getting into the music business with her dad’s blessing already given.

Celebrities like&nbsp;DJ Khaled,&nbsp;Alec Monopoly&nbsp;and Pistol Pete were also there while&nbsp;Rich the Kid&nbsp;and&nbsp;Angelica Villa rocked the party with their performances.</p><p>The “What’s Luv” rapper has two sons, Joey, and Ryan from his previous relationships. While Joey was born in December 1992, Ryan was born three years later in 1995.</p><p>Some years back, Joe opened up about his&nbsp;oldest son, Joey, who has autism in a Facebook post. he wrote. Declaring his unreserved love for Joey, the rapper described him as his angel and the reason for all his blessings.</p><p>He had Joey when he was&nbsp;very young and at that time, he felt he was not ready to have children. After his birth, his mother could not handle him because of his condition so Joe and his parents raised him.</p><p><strong>What To Know About His Brother</strong></p><p>Fat Joe has a brother, Andre, who introduced him to&nbsp;rap music when he was still a teenager. They were both influenced by&nbsp;the Zulu Nation culture and before Joe’s music career kicked off, his brother would always attend&nbsp;Zulu Nation events and come back with tapes&nbsp;of songs from the event to introduce to him. In the course of time, Fat Joe over-showed his brother in the music industry, becoming more popular.</p><p>Apart from Andre, the rapper also referred to&nbsp;rapper&nbsp;Big Pun&nbsp;as his brother. Even though they can easily pass as brothers, they have no biological relationship. The duo&nbsp;met in 1995 and in the same year, Pun featured on Joe’s album,&nbsp;Jealous Ones Still Envy.</p><p>Big Pun died of a heart attack in February 2000, at the age of 28 after battling with weight gain for many years. His memory still lives with his friend-turned-brother, Fat Joe, as he frequently pays tribute to him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height></span><strong>Height</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fat Joe measures&nbsp;5 feet 10½ inches (179 cm) tall and as his name suggests, he has a massive weight that makes him stand out.&nbsp;His weight is listed as 130 kg (287 lbs).
