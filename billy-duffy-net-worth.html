Together, they exploited the Southern Death Cult's success by calling themselves Death Cult. Despite some initial fanfare and a couple of singles, the band chose to shed the name in 1984 in favor of the shortened The Cult. Duffy moved to Los Angeles in 1988 with Astbury, where both remain. There, the two writing partners, along with longtime bassist Jamie Stewart, turned to stadium rock and recorded "Sonic Temple". The Cult reached a larger, mainstream audience with this release.</p><p>Real Estate: In 2016, Billy paid $2.6 million for a home in Los Angeles above the Sunset Strip.
