“Hi. 👋🏻 Jones Douglas Novlan. 7 weeks early. 3.9 lbs.” Ewell, 36, captioned a photo of her baby boy’s hand wrapped around her and Novlan’s fingers via Instagram on Sunday, June 12.
“He couldn’t wait to join us,” the “Directionally Challenged” podcast host explained.
The Roswell, New Mexico star, who announced her pregnancy in February, didn’t go into details about delivering her baby ahead of schedule, but she assured followers that all was well despite the schedule change."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

How it grows, changes and knows exactly what it needs to do. Proud of all the mama’s out there and excited to join the club.”</p><p>Before welcoming Jones, the California native revealed that her baby bump was written into her role on ABC’s The Rookie. “As an actor it’s not often you’re pregnancy is written into a role. Huge thank you to all the writers and producers of @therookieabc for embracing motherhood,” she shared via Instagram in May. “What a constant joy it is to work on this show. If you missed this week’s episode, it’s now streaming on @hulu.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGavmZ2ltrOxjJ2gmqqZmsBut8Cyo5pllayyrbiMoKCvnaNir6q%2B06Fkraddl66jxYxwZLCdlaDAbrHAq6OyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
