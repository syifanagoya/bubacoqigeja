That clears up absolutely nothing, because Semiramis comes with her own set of questions.&nbsp;She was an Assyrian ruler from the 9th century BC — a few centuries before Nebuchadnezzar. Her original name, says <a href=# data-darkreader-inline-color>National Geographic</a>, was Sammu-ramat before it was Hellenized to Semiramis, and no one can really decide what she was.</p><p>Sammu-ramat ruled for just five years, and records have her as a fearless military leader, the builder of Babylon, a tragic figure at the center of an ancient love story, and some credit her with a semi-divine heritage. It was the Greek writer Strabo who credited her as being the creator of the garden, but according to <a href=# data-darkreader-inline-color>Oxford Reference</a>, Strabo lived between 63 BC and 23 AD. That was nine centuries after Sammu-ramat, and it's unclear just where this idea came from — there's no historical records of such a connection.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCj3Jna3BfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2ptaZ5x5qloKGenHqordGdnKerXaSzbq7Am7Clp55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
