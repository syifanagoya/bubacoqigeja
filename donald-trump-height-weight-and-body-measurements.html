(6’1) good company… based on Donald Trump’s height.</span></p><p><span>In December 2016, there was a little problem Donald and his doctor said earlier that he was 6ft 3in, while his driver’s license showed 6ft 2in.</span></p><p><span>There was some speculation that he has something to do with a BMI issue, according to&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Time</span></strong><span>, Trump may want to add an inch to his height to avoid being classified as clinically obese.&nbsp;The explanation was, i.e. he weighs 236kg, if he is 6′ 3”, which puts his BMI at 29.5 – overweight, but not obese.&nbsp;But if he is indeed 6’2”, which appears to be the case, then his BMI is 30.3, which means he is officially obese.</span></p><p><span>Here is a list of notable celebrities who stand as tall as him.&nbsp;Steve
