Due to scheduling conflicts with his new film series, Horizon: An American Saga, which he is both directing and starring in, <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=492>Kevin Costner</a> is leaving Yellowstone.&nbsp;</p><p>Season 5 of Yellowstone was broken up into two parts, but before filming for the second part began, Costner expressed that he wanted to film for fewer days than what he was originally scheduled for.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kevin-Costner-1024x576.jpg><p>At the time, Deadline reported that Costner wanted to film for 50 days instead of 65 for Part 1, and for Part 2, he only wanted to film for a week, which Yellowstone executives felt was too short.</p><p>Negotiations between the two sides went back and forth before coming to an abrupt end.</p><p>Then, it was revealed that Yellowstone’s fifth season, part two, would be its final one and that a brand-new show starring Matthew McConaughey would ostensibly replace it.</p><p>When he broke his silence on his departure, Costner stated that he had wanted to make things work and that he had already changed his schedule to film Part 1, and scripts for Part 2 weren’t finished.&nbsp;</p><p>I couldn’t help them anymore. We tried to negotiate, and they offered me less money than in previous seasons.</p><p>There were issues with the creative. We came up with a number, and Yellowstone walked away.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Kevin Costner & Modern West (@kevincostnermodernwest)</a></p><p>In addition, Costner has hinted that he might file a lawsuit to receive his full payment for Season 5, so it seems like things could get heated once more.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Costner is leaving the program, this does not imply that he will not return to the show in the future.</p><p>It is said that discussions are still ongoing about Costner making a few cameos to finish off his character’s arc before he is written off.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Taylor Sheridan, the showrunner, hinted to The Hollywood Reporter that John Dutton would never make it to the very end of the series and that his preferred conclusion remains unaltered even in light of Costner’s departure.</p><p>In any case, it might be some time before we find out what transpires with Yellowstone and Costner.</p><p>The SAG-AFTRA strike is still going strong, so it is possible that we will not see the final Yellowstone episodes until 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Kevin Costner married?</strong></h2><p>The 18-year union between Christine Baumgartner and Kevin Costner has ended.
