It really was, and I just had to fall back and go, damn this is a really, really good thing.”</p><p>He went on to reveal: “When you’re in your own relationship, sometimes, you know, sometimes you do things spontaneously, sometimes you move too fast, sometimes you make mistakes, you know what I mean? And so… I’m not saying that that’s what I did, or that I made a mistake, but I don’t know if I did make a mistake. I don’t know. I have every right to just not know and still just try to figure it out.”</p><p>Host Jeannie Mai asked Ray J if he wants “a happy, stable, loyal marriage,” to which Brandy Norwood’s brother responded by “Yeah, don’t beat me up!”</p><p>Jeannie asked if he would go to marriage counseling with the mother of his children. He replied by: “I would be up for it. I would be up for whatever it is to make sure that my kids have a strong foundation and have both their parents in their lives 24/7.”</p><p>The Love & Hip Hop Hollywood star also did an interview where she revealed that she was in tears when she found out about the divorce. She confessed: “I was calling him, and I was texting him.”</p><p>Princess Love said this about reuniting with Ray J: “I wasn’t calling to [cry about it]. I feel like right now, we just…I don’t know. We just need to just really figure out—no, I don’t. Not right now, I don’t.”</p><p>Princess Love set the Internet on fire with a series of stunning bathing suit photos on Instagram. The model showed her curves in a tiny string swimsuit.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Will they reconcile?</p><span><a href=# rel=prev><img width=150 height=27 alt="Next Article" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilsZuttJmnKysopa7qLHDZq6inpVivbO1zZycrKtdoby3sYydqaioo2KvosDHoqWgZaOqtrV5z6GmraejYsGprdNmrqKknGK1osLEZp%2BipV2Xsqh5x56pZqafqXq1u4ydoK%2BnopiybrTIpmRta2ltfXl7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
