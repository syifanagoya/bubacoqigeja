Although Madeline actively disliked Bonnie during season one, the new sneak peek appears to show her reaching out to her husband's new wife by visiting their home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a14a56ae8634-bll-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eubaoCg5Q_u9 data-wc=9><strong>Reese Witherspoon plays Madeline, while Zoe Kravitz plays Bonnie</strong></p><p id=ehxKpbR8PcGS data-wc=79>A third photo shows the first look at Renata (played by Laura Dern), who was Jane's adversary in the first season as she believed Jane's son Ziggy was bullying her daughter, Amabella. However, after it was revealed that it was actually one of Celeste's twins who was terrorising Amabella while copying his father's behaviour towards his mother, Renata appears to have very much become part of the group of mums, particularly since she was also present at Perry's death.</p><p id=eOhqz4X1ypyd data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> Jason Isaacs drops huge hint on when Netflix's The OA season two will drop</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e186bec18e8-bll-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eFWhi45MW05E data-wc=6><strong>Renata is played by Laura Dern</strong></p><p id=e_z7mEtAif6y data-wc=147>The fourth snap shows all of the main characters – Jane, Bonnie, Renata, Madeline and Celeste – looking around at an unknown person while on the school run. Speaking of whether a season three is planned, Nicole recently said: "There's no plan for it to end, specifically...This was a long shoot for us, and it was an enormous amount of work, and we're just amazed that we can be here. Not to compare it to the first one because artistically it's a wonderful thing to take something and go and the success of the first one was so massive, so we go, 'OK, let's jump off the cliff.' But at the same time, it is its own entity and hopefully it will be taken that way. It was definitely made with an enormous amount of love." The new series will air on Sky Atlantic in summer 2019.</p><p id=eEw3H3JcYFTu data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#> 12 Valentine's Day movies that have something for everyone</a></strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
