When the Chargers tied the game at 17 points in the 4th quarter, they couldn't help but laud the fan wearing a Justin Herbert jersey:</p><p>"I mean, just pure ecstasy. This Chargers fan, as the Chargers have tied it at 17", Joe Buck first said. Which Aikman then followed up with: "If there's a definition of pure ecstasy, that's it." To which Buck replied: "I mean, that was intense!"</p><p>As expected, the cameras panned onto the fan when <strong>Stephon Gilmore</strong> intercepted <strong>Justin Herbert</strong> late in the 4th quarter, sealing the victory for the Cowboys. Her reaction, of course, was one of pure disappointment.</p><p>Viewers were equally amused, confused and in awe of the Chargers fan.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Viral Chargers fan's identity was revealed on Tuesday</h2><p><strong>Merriane Do</strong> was a special guest on the Pat McAfee Show on ESPN. The Chargers superfan, who stole the spotlight on MNF, was asked if she was offended by the online conspiracies alluding to her being a "<a href=#>plant by the NFL</a>" or fake fan.</p><p>Merriane took it in stride, saying she wished she "was being paid". "I wish I were AI and could make myself as beautiful as I want. But this is me, I am who I am. A mother of four, and a crazy Chargers fan", she said.</p><p>I am who I am: a mother of four, and a crazy Chargers fan.</p><span class=ue-c-article__blockquote-author>Merriane Do</span><p>"It's overwhelming the world has realized that this is so different, because my kids have to deal with this on the regular (at their sports games)", <strong>Merriane Do</strong> told McAfee and his co-hosts.</p><p>She was also completely unaware of having been the star on Week 6's Monday Night Football: "We go to a ton of games and they always get me on the jumbotron but I've never been on TV. I didn't realize what had happened until I got home and my kids told me".</p><p>Despite the utter disappointment at the Chargers' MNF loss, <strong>Merriane </strong>made it clear that she will "never lose faith" in her Chargers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWecpMBurc2gnKWdo2Kwqa3RoJyrq19nfXN%2FjmpnaGlnZIN2fsRpZ2xwYmeDcX3DcJptcWiXgXaFkWefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
