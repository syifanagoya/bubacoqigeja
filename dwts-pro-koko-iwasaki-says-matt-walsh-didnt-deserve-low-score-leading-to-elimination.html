Quite disappointed, to be honest,” Koko said about getting eliminated. “But at the end of the day, this experience with Matt, we went through so much in the last few weeks,&nbsp;and I wouldn’t have changed it for the world.”</p><p>“I’ve said this so many times, but I would have Matt every season if I could,” Koko said of her dance partner.</p><p>“I don’t think that he deserved 4s, I’ll be honest. He wasn’t the best dancer, you know, he’s never danced before, it’s something still new. But he was really great last night and he worked so hard,” Iwasaki shared.</p><p>“He’s been through a lot, we’ve been through a lot together, and our journey was short, but I don’t think he deserved 4s last night.”</p><p>“It wasn’t his time yet! He did so well, we did real cha-cha,” Koko said while suggesting that the judges really should go back and watch their dance again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mauricio-umansky-also-did-not-impress-at-the-dwts-season-32-premiere>Mauricio Umansky also did not impress at the DWTS Season 32 premiere</h2><p>One of the biggest disappointments on premiere night was The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills husband, Mauricio Umansky.</p><p>Kyle Richards’ estranged husband looked stiff on the dance floor and didn’t hit quite a few moves as he tried to do a jive with pro partner Emma Slater.</p><p>It didn’t help that, ahead of the live performance, he didn’t even know what a jive was, and we can only hope that when he’s assigned a Latin dance, he’ll show us better moves.</p><p>If not, Mauricio can count his days on DWTS because, even with RHOBH fans voting for him, there are way better dancers competing this season on the ABC dance competition.</p><p>Dancing with the Stars airs on Tuesdays at 8/7c on ABC and Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5SswbR5z6umZqOfoLxutdaaqpqjmWLAosXSZqSarKRixKK40qFknaGUo8FusMSsnKuulWK5sMOMrJqoqpViuaatw6KloGWkpHqmuMimoKeZpJ68r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
