She took the world by storm when the series premiered in 2017, and she’s kept us <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">glued to our screens every season since</a>.</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>Moss is a frequent flier in the gossip sphere, most likely due to her status <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as an unproblematic star</a>. She doesn’t land in headlines because she’s in some new beef, she doesn’t change relationships every other week, and she cherry picks her projects based on her own interests. In a sea of complicated, dramatic actors, she’s a breath of fresh air.</p><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>But she’s also pretty private, which leaves her fans with plenty of questions. Over the years, Moss has been linked to a few high profile men — even wedding one back in the 2000s — but she works hard to keep her personal and professional life separate. That, paired with Moss’ status as a woman with an actual human-shaped body, leads to frequently resurfacing queries about pregnancy.</p><h2 id=h-is-elisabeth-moss-expecting-a-child data-injectable=false>Is Elisabeth Moss expecting a child?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Elizabeth-Moss.jpg><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Moss is one of painfully few women in Hollywood <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with some actual curves on her</a>. She looks like a regular 41-year-old woman, albeit a very pretty and talented one, and that drives the beauty-obsessed masses insane. They think there must be some reason she can’t fit inside your average traffic cone, and — since she’s a lady, with lady parts — they come to the same obnoxious conclusion: Pregnancy.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>No, Elizabeth Moss is not pregnant, nor does it appear she ever has been. She’s sported the pregnant look a few times, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high-profile roles</a> like the aforementioned Offred, but off-screen Moss toys with the idea of motherhood, but has yet to take the plunge.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>She has gushed, in the past, about how much she’d enjoy motherhood. She’s joked about how wonderful an upbringing her own mother provided, and even teased that, should she ever have kids of her own, she’d pass them off to her mom for a prime parenthood experience.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Moss was briefly married to SNL alumnus Fred Armisen between late 2009 and mid-2010, but they split after less than a year together, and never welcomed any children into the fold. Both halves of the brief marriage have alluded to its toxicity behind the scenes, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Armisen even admitting</a> that he was a “terrible husband.”</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=712 data-injectable=false>Moss isn’t currently seeing anyone — at least publicly — and it doesn’t seem she has any plans to expand the family soon. For now, and maybe forever, she’s focused in on her (thriving) career. That’s something women sometimes choose to do (shocker, I know), and constantly haranguing her about expanding her family isn’t going to change that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnEpaCsmZKawal5zKiqrGWgp7KousCnq2aZnqjEpr7EnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
