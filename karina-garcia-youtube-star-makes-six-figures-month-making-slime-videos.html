The craze has produced at least one bona fide star in Karina Garcia, a 23-year-old who, according to&nbsp;The New York Times,&nbsp;is making a consistent six figures a month churning out slime for her more than 5.7 million YouTube subscribers.</p><p>Garcia is pulling in between $20,000 and $60,000 a month for very lucrative sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Disney. That comes to a bare minimum of $100,000 per month, according to Garcia herself, and on "a good month" she finds herself with checks of up to $200,000. And her parents have no reason to be ashamed of their slime-loving daughter, because also according to her:</p><p>"I've retired my parents. It's definitely really crazy. Even I can't believe it."</p><p>Her slimy fame on the internet has also allowed Garcia to sign a book deal, to write&nbsp;DIY Slime, a book containing 15 of her recipes for homemade slime. Her approach to the stuff far outstrips large outfits like Nickelodeon and the Silly Putty people in terms of novel innovation – for instance, one of her most popular recipes is for an "Edible Slime" made out of pink Starburst candy.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-228668 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Karina-Garcia-e1500360609958.jpg alt width=900 height=506 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-228668 class=wp-caption-text>Karina Garcia</p><p>Within seven months of starting to put slime videos online, Garcia began to turn a profit on what, up to that point, would have been considered a hobby. Soon after, she was supporting not just her parents financially, but her siblings as well. She also purchased a six-bedroom house, &nbsp;with a (water-filled) swimming pool as well as a recreation room and home theater. The obvious thing to call such a house would be "The House that Slime Built," but people might not want to come over to a house named after slime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoopqqmaOubrPAq5qimV2uvLbA1JucZquklr9uucCknKxlo57FbrLIoKyrnaNiurC606FkppmbnruoedKloKadXau2pbHOrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
