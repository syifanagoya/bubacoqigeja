approximately <strong>$ 10 million</strong> from his musical career between 1988 and 1990.</p><p>His musical career started as the MC of the team DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince.</p><p>Smith’s childhood friend Jeffrey&nbsp; ‘DJ Jazzy Jeff’ Townes was the turntablist and producer.</p><p>He also enlisted Clarence Holmes (Ready Rock C) to form a trio as the group’s beatboxer.</p><p>DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince’s debut single <strong>“<a href=# rel=noopener>Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble</a>,”</strong> off their debut album Rock the House, was released in 1986.</p><p>A month before Will graduated from high school, it became a hit.</p><p>Furthermore, their debut album was released on Philadelphia-based Word Up Records in 1986 and was released on Jive Records later in March 1987.</p><p>The duo earned their first Grammy for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for “<a href=# rel=noopener>Parents Just Don’t Understand</a>” (1988).</p><p>Nevertheless, the most successful single was <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Summertime</a>,’ reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning their second Grammy.</p><p>But, when Smith underpaid his taxes, IRS (Internal Revenue Service) assessed a $2.8&nbsp;million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income.</p><h3>Movie and Solo Music Career</h3><p>Will was struggling financially when the <a title href=# rel=noopener>NBC</a> television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, <i><a title href=# rel=noopener>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>, in 1990.</i></p><p>This show was a hit that helped Will launch his acting career. <i><br></i></p><p>Then in the 1993 drama, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Six Degrees of Separation</a>,</strong> he appeared as the main character.</p><p>His action movie Bad Boys (1995) grossed <strong>$141.4 million</strong> worldwide.</p><p>One of his hit movies, <strong>‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Men in Black</a>,’</strong> released in 1997, grossed over <strong>$589.4 million</strong> worldwide on a<strong> $90 million budget.</strong></p><p>It was also the year’s third highest-grossing film, with around <strong>54,616,700 tickets sold in the
